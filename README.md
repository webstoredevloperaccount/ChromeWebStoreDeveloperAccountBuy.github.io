# Chrome Extension Development — Landing Page

This is a minimal, fast landing page hosted with **GitHub Pages** to attract clients on Telegram (**@Namatnb**) for legitimate Chrome extension development, guidance and maintenance.

> **Note:** This site and service do **not** sell or transfer Chrome Web Store developer accounts. It focuses on compliant development and publishing help.

## Quick Start

1. Create a public repo named **`yourusername.github.io`** (replace with your exact GitHub username).
2. Upload these files: `index.html`, `style.css`, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, `.nojekyll`.
3. In the repo: **Settings → Pages →** Set Branch to `main`, folder to `/ (root)`, click **Save**.
4. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io` within a minute or two.

## Google Search Console (GSC)

1. Go to Google Search Console and add property: **URL prefix** → `https://yourusername.github.io`
2. Choose **HTML tag** verification. Copy the `<meta name="google-site-verification" ...>` tag.
3. Paste the tag **inside `<head>`** of `index.html` (there’s a comment placeholder already), then commit.
4. Back in GSC, click **Verify**. Submit `sitemap.xml`.

## Custom Domain (optional)

- Buy a domain from any registrar, add it as **Custom Domain** in **Settings → Pages**.
- Create A/AAAA records according to GitHub Pages docs and enable HTTPS.

## Editing Text

Open `index.html` and edit the copy (headings, description). Keep the Telegram link if you want quick contact.
